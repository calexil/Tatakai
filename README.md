## Story
Gathered on the world stage for the first time ever, the greatest martial arts masters in the world compete for the title of "Combat Master"

The struggle of mankind to reach a peaceful coeexistance has forced the governments of the world to think of other methods of settling the disputes of their respective nations.

Instead of continuing on with violent and repulsive wars, the "Combat Master Tournament" Was created... Pitting the worlds greatest fighters against each other to settle the many border, financial, religious, and other disaggrements the world faces. Through the pure, unbiased, and cleansing force of physical combat.
